# Trepo
Welcome to the Trepo Project. This is a meta-repo of sorts for all things Trepo - Project Direction, Motivation, Roadmap, etc.

## What is Trepo
Trepo is an open source genealogy API. It comes with a versioned genealogical database, a distributed query framework, and a set of extensible research and data models. All of this is wrapped in a language agnostic API specification and supplemented with HTML5 Web Components.

* [Discussions](https://github.com/trepo/project/issues) - Just create an issue and we'll talk about it.

## Other Stuff
